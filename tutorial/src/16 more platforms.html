    <p>This part will be pretty easy now that we have systems in place to handle resolving our collisions, we can add platforms wherever we want and they will just work.</p>
    <p>To start let's add another platform in <strong>src/data/entities.json</strong> like so:</p>
  </div>

</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <pre><code class="json">
      {
        "id": 5,

        "position": {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 450
        },
        "size": {
          "width": 406,
          "height": 41
        },
        "collisions": [],
        "image":{
          "name":"platform.png"
        }
      }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Be sure the ids of any platforms you add are unique, and add another:</p>

    <pre><code class="json">
      {
        "id":6,

        "position": {
          "x": 394,
          "y": 600
        },
        "size": {
          "width": 406,
          "height": 41
        },
        "collisions": [],
        "image":{
          "name":"platform.png"
        }
      }
    </code></pre>
  </div>

</div>  <div class="row">

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
    <p>You should recognize what each of the components in these platform entities is doing by now, but here is a quick recap:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>id - A unique number for each entity, the engine reads this to keep track of each entity</li>
      <li>platform - This is so we can later write systems that target only "platforms" which is just a name we made up for these. This just acts as a tag, and you can make up any tags like this with any name you desire.</li>
      <li>position - This is the position of the top left of the entity to let Splat ECS know where to draw it.</li>
      <li>size - The width and height of the entity, this is it's collision are as well, the size of the object the player will bump into.</li>
      <li>collisions - Anything that you need to track collisions on will need this component, it has an array of the ids of all other entities it is currently intersecting.</li>
      <li>image : name - The image to draw on the entity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So now if you play the game in your browser you will be able to jump onto the other platforms! You might notice that the jumping in the game acts a bit weird, you can continue to jump over and over and there is no way to stop sticky baby from jumping in mid-air!</p>
