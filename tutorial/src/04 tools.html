		<h4>Browser</h4>
		<p>Since Splat-ECS is for making games that run primarily in the browser, you will need  to have a browser open to preview your game while you are working on it. We recomend <a href="http://google.com/chrome" target="_blank"> Google Chrome</a> or <a href="http://firefox.com" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>.</p>
		<h4> Text editor</h4>
		<p> To write the JavaScript code and JSON data that makes up your game you will need a text editor, if you don't already have a preference, here are some open source recommendations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank"> Atom</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Terminal (Command Line)</h4>
		<p>Splat-ECS uses the Node Package Manager (NPM) to install and update itself, and webpack to let you build and test the game live in your broswer as you code. To use NPM and also the build tool, you will need to use the terminal, sometimes referred to as the Command Line Interface or CLI. If you are unfamiliar with the terminal in your operating system please check out these handy resources:</p>

			<p>Check for the ' <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-console"></i> ' symbol in this tutorial, that means you need to type or copy a command into the terminal.</p>
		</div>


		<h4>Node.js</h4>
		<p>It is also required to have Node installed. To check if you have Node installed you can type this command in your terminal <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-console"></i> <code>node -v</code> and hit enter, this should return a version number such as <strong>v6.3.1</strong> or let you know that you don't have Node installed.</p>

		<p>To install node please refer to the instructions for your operating system here: <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a>.</p>

		<h4> Splat ECS Engine</h4>
