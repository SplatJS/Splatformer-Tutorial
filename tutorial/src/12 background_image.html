		<p>It is a bit hard to belive that our hero Sticky Baby lives in such a bleak world, so let's go ahead and add a simple background image to our game. This is really easy because Splat ECS handles all the drawing of entities with images for us. Let's take the entity with the <code>"id": 2</code> that we just created in the last step and add a couple of new components to it. Open up <strong>src/data/entities.json</strong> again and add <code>"name"</code>,<code>"position"</code>, and <code>"image"</code>:</p>
	</div>

</div><div class="row">

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
<pre><code class="json">
	{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "background",
    "position": {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0
    },
    "size": {
      "width": 800,
      "height": 800
    },
    "image": {
      "name": "sky.png"
    }
	}
</code></pre>

				<p>The <code>name</code> component is really just for us as developers to know which entity we are looking at. The engine, on the other hand, knows each entity by it's id. <code>"position"</code> is the x &amp; y coordinates of where to start drawing that entity, in this case 0,0 is the top left of the game canvas. <code>"size"</code> is the size of the background, and <code>"image"</code> contains a property for the name of the background image.</p>

				<p>Now we should see a background with rolling green hills, a deep blue sky, and fluffy white clouds for our game, just the way sticky baby likes it!</p>
