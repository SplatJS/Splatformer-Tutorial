		<p>We are almost done, we have a pretty real feeling game now, but I want to show you one more thing, rendering text on the screen, and to do this we will add a score counter.</p>
		<p>This will be our first and only render system necessary for the tutorial. Let's delete the <strong>src/systems/renderer/sample-renderer-system.js</strong> and add a new file inside of <strong>src/systems/renderer/</strong>, let's name it <strong>draw-score.js</strong></p>
	</div>

</div><div class="row">

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
		<p>The contents of <strong>draw-score.js</strong> should be as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">
"use strict";

module.exports = function(ecs, game) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
	ecs.addEach(function harvest(entity, context) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
		var score = game.entities.get(entity, "score");

		context.fillStyle = "#fff";
		context.font = "bold 26px arial";
		context.fillText("Goo: " + score, 16, 35);

	} ,"player");
};
</code></pre>
	</div>

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
		<p>This code will run one per frame for each entity with the <code>"player"</code> component, which should be familiar by now, but there is one main difference that rendering systems have - they draw things to the screen or <strong>context</strong>.</p>
		<p>To draw the score we want to draw normal text to the screen and to do this we can use normal html5 canvas functions. I will explain each line staring with <code>var score</code></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a variable for the player's <code>"score"</code> component (which we will add after)</li>
			<li>Set the color of the text, in our case <strong>#fff</strong> for white.</li>
			<li>Set the font to bold 26px arial.</li>
			<li>Draw the text "Goo:" to the screen followed by the number of the player's current score at the position x:16, y:35.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="col-xs-12">
		<p>We now - you guessed it - need to add this new system to <strong>src/data/systems.json</strong>, I recommend adding it right before <code>draw-frame-rate</code> in the <code>"renderer":[]</code> array this time.</p>

<pre><code class="json">
{
	"name": "./systems/renderer/draw-score",
	"scenes": [
	"main"
	]
}
</code></pre>

		<p>Also while you have this file open, remove this sample system reference:</p>
<pre><code class="json">
{
	"name": "./systems/renderer/sample-renderer-system",
	"scenes": [
	"main"
	]
}
</code></pre>

		<p>Now we need to give the player a <code>"score"</code> component, and add a way to increase the score.</p>

		<p>Let's start by adding this to our player entity in <strong>src/data/entities.json</strong>: <code>"score": 0,</code> </p>

		<p>This component starts the player with 0 score and will serve as the place for us to store the score as it increases.</p>

		<p>Next we need to pick the event that will increase the score, this should be the moment when the goo entity the player touches is destroyed.</p>

		<p>Open up <strong>src/systems/simulation/collect-goo.js</strong> again and let's add a few lines:</p>

		<p>Here is how the file will look after we add two lines, one to get the <code>"score"</code> component of the player entity, and one to add the amount of points (from the goo's `points` component) to it each time the player grabs a ball of goo.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
"use strict";

module.exports = function(ecs, game) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
	ecs.addEach(function collectGoo(entity, elapsed) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
		var entityCollisions = game.entities.get(entity, "collisions");
		var score = game.entities.get(entity, "score");

		for (var i = 0; i < entityCollisions.length; i++) {
			var other = entityCollisions[i];
			var points = game.entities.get(other, "points");
			if (points) {
				game.entities.destroy(other);
				game.entities.set(entity, "score", score + points);
			}
		}
	}, "playerController2d");

};
</code></pre>

		<p>Now if you try out the game in your browser you should be able to run around and collect all 12 balls of goo.</p>
