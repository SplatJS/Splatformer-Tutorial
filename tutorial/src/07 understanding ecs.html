<h3>The foundational concepts behind Splat ECS</h3>
<p>Splat ECS uses an Entity Component system or ECS for short, as the name implies this is a very important part of Splat ECS. ECS is at the core and you will need to understand the ECS mindset while working on your game. But don't worry, you will ease into it and it will begin to become clear to you why ECS was chosen, as it is a very powerful and organized design pattern.</p>

	<strong>Entities</strong> <p>Represent objects in your game and serve as containers for components.</p>

	<strong>Systems</strong> <p>Code that processes entities which have specific components in order to enact the behaviors those components represent.</p>

<h5>Splat ECS basics</h5>
<ul>
	<li>All objects in the game that you can interact with should be entities</li>
	<li>The only way to modify an entity is to edit or delete it's components or add new components</li>
	<li>Systems run in the game loop (once per frame)</li>
	<li>Systems are where your JavaScript code will live, and there are two types &mdash; Renderer and Simulation</li>
</ul>
