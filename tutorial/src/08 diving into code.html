		<h4>Diving into code</h4>
<p>Let's get into some code.</p>
<p>Everything you will ever edit in your game is inside the <strong>src/</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Let's examine the existing game code for the sample project.</p>
<p>If you remember there was a black outlined square and keyboard controls, how does that work?</p>
<h4>Entities and their Components</h4>
<p>Open up the game project in your code editor or choice.</p>
<p>Open <strong>src/data</strong> and you will notice several <strong>.json</strong> files, these are the core of your game because this is where we will store all of the game's data.</p>


<div class="alert alert-info">
	<i class="fa fa-th"></i>
	<strong>Data-driven game development</strong>
	<p>Much of how the game is set up (players, enemies, items, backgrounds, animations) is stored as data in JSON format.</p>
</div>

<p>If you open up <strong>src/data/entities.json</strong> you will see an array of entities called <strong>main</strong>, this is a <strong>scene</strong>. All of the entities contained by the <strong>main</strong> scene are inside the '[ ]'</p>

<pre><code class="json">{
 "main": [
  {
   "id": 0,
   "name": "camera",
   "camera": true,
   "position": {
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0
   },
   "matchCanvasSize": true
  },
  {
   "id": 1,
   "name": "player",
   "position": {
    "x": 100,
    "y": 100
   },
   "size": {
    "width": 100,
    "height": 100
   },
   "velocity": {
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0
   },
   "playerController2d": {
    "up": "up",
    "down": "down",
    "left": "left",
    "right": "right"
   },
   "movement2d": {
    "upMax": -0.5,
    "downMax": 0.5,
    "leftMax": -0.5,
    "rightMax": 0.5,
    "upAccel": -0.02,
    "downAccel": 0.02,
    "leftAccel": -0.02,
    "rightAccel": 0.02
   },
   "friction": {
    "x": 0.97,
    "y": 0.97
   }
  }
 ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>id</code> of 1, <code>name</code>, <code>position</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>velocity</code>, <code>playerController2d</code>, <code>movement2d</code>, and <code>friction</code>. This is the player entity, it is just a bucket that holds components and has an id.</p>

<p>This is our black-outlined box from before, it is a rectangle that is 100x100 and it's top left corner is drawn at coordinate x:100 and y:100 on the screen. Everything in our game world is based on coordinates like a graph, the top left point is x:0, y:0 as you move right the x number increases, and as you move down the y number increases. The <code>position</code>, and <code>size</code> objects are what we call components in the ECS world, they can be added, edited, or deleted to make an entity have different properties and/or behaviours.</p>

<p>The player entity is controllable with WASD or arrow keys, this works using the <code>playerController2d</code> component built into Splat ECS.</p>

<p>Splat ECS handles rendering of all entities for us, and by default there is a system called <code>draw-rectangles</code> that will outline each entity in a thin black line to let us know where they are. While this system is excellent for debugging, we will want to disable it once we get futher along.</p>

<h4>Systems</h4>

<p>So we have seen entities and components so far, what about systems? Let's open up the <strong>systems</strong> folder and see what is inside. In the <strong>systems</strong> folder you will see two other folders named <strong>renderer</strong>, and <strong>simulation</strong>.</p>

<p>These are the only two types of systems you will need in Splat ECS. <strong>Renderer systems</strong> draw to the screen, and <strong>Simulation systems</strong> do everything else.</p>

<p>Splat ECS uses the <a href="http://www.requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html" target="_blank">Common JS module format</a> for all system modules you will be creating. Let's open the file <strong>src/systems/simulation/sample-simulation-system.js</strong> Inside this system we will see how we format our code in Splat ECS. Here you will see <code>module.exports</code> on line 3, this is the code to export the module for use by the game project and is vital that you wrap your code in this.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
	<p>Don't get intimidated by the code here, the sample systems are there for you to use as templates that you can copy each time to create your own systems.</p>
</div>
<p>You will notice the arguments <code>ecs</code> and <code>game</code>. Every chunk of system code in Splat ECS is run through the ECS so it must be included. <code>game</code> is everything in the data folder which becomes a large JavaScript object when the game is built.</p>

<p>This process might seem overwhelming but it will become easier with time.</p>

<p>So to get started let's add a sprite for our player!</p>
