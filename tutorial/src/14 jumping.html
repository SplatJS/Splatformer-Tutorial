    <p>To add jumping we will first need to add a jump button in the game's list for usable inputs. Splat ECS uses virtual buttons so you can name a button "action" or "jump" or whatever you like and assign as many keyboard keys to it as you like.</p>
    <h3>Adding a new input</h3>
    <p>To add a new input you will need to edit <strong>src/data/inputs.json</strong> inside the file you will see inputs for the up, down, right, and left buttons. We can add a jump button at the top above "up" by adding this JSON:</p>
  </div>

</div><div class="row">

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
<pre><code class="json">
  "jump": [
    {
      "device": "keyboard",
      "button": "space"
    }
  ],
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
    <p>By changing "key" you can map jump to any keyboard key.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <i class="fa fa-gamepad"></i><strong>Splat-ECS supports controllers!</strong>
      <p>Just like <strong>"keyboard"</strong>, you can use <strong>"gamepad"</strong> as a device type in <strong>src/data/inputs.json</strong> you can use <strong>"a"</strong> for the jump button and try it out on your usb controller of choice!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</div><div class="row">

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
    <p>Now that we have added a new input we can create a new system for jumping. create a new file in the <strong>src/systems/simulation</strong> folder and name it <strong>jump.js</strong></p>
    <p>Inside of <strong>src/systems/simulation</strong> there will be a file named <strong>sample-simulation-system.js</strong> this is a sample system that acts as a useful template for creating your own systems. Duplicate this file and rename it <strong>jump.js</strong></p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <strong>Pro tip</strong>
      <p>Leaving both the <strong>sample-simulation-system.js</strong> and <strong>sample-rendering-system.js</strong> in your project will save you time when you create new systems, they are handy templates!</p>
    </div>
    <p>Inside the <strong>src/systems/simulation/jump.js</strong> file you just created you will notice the word <code>"playerController2d"</code> on line 5, this is letting the ECS know which entities to apply this system to, in this particular case it will apply your code to any entities with a component named <code>"playerController2d"</code>.</p>
    <p>Let's add a variable inside our system to store the player's velocity. To get values out of the entity's components in Splat ECS we use the get method. Since everything in the entity pool has a unique ID, the ID is what we use to tell Splat ECS which entity we are looking for. Since the system is applying the code to each entity with a <code>"playerController2d"</code> component it acts a lot like a loop, the "entity" attribute on line 4 is the id of the current entity it is running on. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
    <strong>src/systems/simulation/jump.js</strong>
<pre><code class="javascript">
  "use strict";

  module.exports = function(ecs, game) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
  	ecs.addEach(function jump(entity, elapsed) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
  		var velocity = game.entities.get(entity, "velocity");

  		if (game.inputs.buttonPressed("jump")) {
  			velocity.y  = -1.2;
  		}

  	}, "playerController2d");

  };

</code></pre>
  </div>

</div><div class="row">

  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <p>Inside the function we are making a variable for the player's velocity on line 5, and then on line 7 we are checking if the "jump" button is pressed.</p>
    <p>There are 3 different <strong>game.input</strong> methods we can use,</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>game.inputs.button("name-here")</strong> true if button is currently down (each frame).</li>
      <li><strong>game.inputs.buttonPressed("name-here")</strong> true for one frame at the beginning of the button press.</li>
      <li><strong>game.inputs.buttonReleased("name-here")</strong> true for one frame when the button is released.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The reason I chose <code>buttonPressed</code> is because it will only jump once when the button is first pressed instead of continually jumping.</p>
    <p>Inside the if block where we are checking the button notice this bit of code: <code>velocity.y  = -1.2; </code>. The reason we are setting the velocity y (up/down axis) to -1.2 is so the player will go up, the 'gravity' we created earlier with <strong>apply-acceleration</strong> will take care of bringing the player back down to earth and the whole process happens again the next time the jump button is pressed.</p>
  </div>

</div><div class="row">

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
    <p>Next we need to register this system in <strong>src/data/systems.json</strong> inside the <code>"simulation": []</code> array because it is a simulation system. We can add it using the following:</p>
<pre><code class="json">
{
  "name": "./systems/simulation/jump",
  "scenes": "all"
},
</code></pre>
    <p>I recommend adding it before <code>control-player</code>.</p>
    <p>We also need to adjust the vertical friction (to disable it actually). To do this we need to set the player entity's friction y to 1:</p>
<pre><code class="json">
  "friction": {
    "x": 0.97,
    "y": 1
  },
</code></pre>
    <p>Now when you view your game in the browser your player will be able to jump when space is pressed. You will probably notice that if you continue to jump you can jump in mid-air, we will fix this later. Now for the element that makes this game a platformer more than anything... platforms!</p>
