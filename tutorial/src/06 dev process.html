		<h2>The development process</h2>
<h4>Trying out the test project</h4>
<p>To run a Splat ECS game all you need to do is type the command: <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-console"></i><code>npm start</code> while in the root of the project folder. This will run webpack, which builds your game and also runs eslint which checks your JavaScript code for errors.</p>
<p><strong>Once you have the webpack server running you simply leave this terminal window open while you work on your game.</strong> Making changes to your game's code and saving them will trigger the webpack server to rebuild the game and your browser will refresh automatically. This is the main workflow you will use while developing your game!</p>

	<strong>A note on code formatting and error checking</strong>
	<p>Splat ECS uses <a href="http://eslint.org/" target="_blank">eslint</a> to test your game code before each time you build it, this will prevent errors or straying from the recommended JavaScript formatting rules. When you build your game you may see errors or warnings, errors prevent the game from building and must be addressed before you can continue.</p>
</div>
<p>You should try running your game to make sure it is working before you continue. When the last line in your terminal reads <strong>'webpack: bundle is now VALID.'</strong> this means webpack is done and now you can open a browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank">localhost:4000</a>.</p>

<p>The Splat ECS sample game is just white screen with a black-outlined square you can control with WASD, or arrow keys. Test that this is working and note that if the keys are not working you may need to click inside the browser window to give the game your 'focus'.</p>
<p>Now that we have a sample game running we can get started.</p>
