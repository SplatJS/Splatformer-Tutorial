    <p>To fix this we need to edit the <strong>src/systems/simulation/jump.js</strong> system a bit, and now that we have platforms it makes since to only let the player jump if the player is standing on top of a platform. Here is the code we use to add that feature and how the system should look after it is added:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
"use strict";

module.exports = function(ecs, game) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
  ecs.addEach(function jump(entity, elapsed) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
    var velocity = game.entities.get(entity, "velocity");

    if (game.inputs.buttonPressed("jump")) {
      var entityCollisions = game.entities.get(entity, "collisions");

      for (var i = 0; i < entityCollisions.length; i++) {
        var other = entityCollisions[i];
        var otherPosition = game.entities.get(other, "position");
        var position = game.entities.get(entity, "position");
        var size = game.entities.get(entity, "size");
        if ((position.y + size.height) <= otherPosition.y) {
          velocity.y  = -1.2;
        }

    <p>This is a bit complicated - so let's break it down step-by-step.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We are adding a variable called <code>entityCollisions</code> so we can loop over all of the other entities the player is currently touching.</li>
      <li>Each time this loop runs it is create a new variable called <code>other</code> which contains the current entity that the player is touching.</li>
      <li>The next bit of code (inside the 'if' statement) only runs if the <code>other</code> entity has a <code>"platform"</code> component.</li>
      <li>Next we are then creating variables for the platform's position, and the player's current size and position.</li>
      <li>if the player's top plus height (player's bottom) is less than or equal to the top  of the platform the player is standing on top of it.</li>
      <li>Let that sucker jump!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So to recap - if the player is touching a platform we are checking to see if the player is above the platform, and if it is, sticky baby can jump!</p>
    <p>Now it is starting to feel like a real game, let's add something else that real games have - animation!</p>
