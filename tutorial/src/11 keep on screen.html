		<p>The next thing we will work on is keeping the player within the bounds of the screen. For our simple game we will always want the player to stay inside of a playable area of 800 by 800 pixels. To do this we need to make use of our first additional system. The system we need to add is called <code>constrain-position</code> and it is part of the Splat-ECS engine so you can use it in any project.</p>

	<p>Next we need to add the <code>constrainPosition</code> component to the player entity, but before we do that we need another entity with a position and size so it can act as an invisible boundary to contain the player, for this we will create a new entity in <strong>/src/data/entities.json</strong> after the player entity.</p>

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "id": 2,
  "position": {
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0
  },
  "size": {
    "width": 800,
    "height": 800
  }
}
</code></pre>

</div>

</div><div class="row">

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
	<p>Since the playable area we are defining above in <code>"id": 2</code> is 800 by 800 pixels, we need to make sure the game is scaled to fit proportionally in the canvas. To do this we need to add the line <code>game.scaleCanvasToFitRectangle(800,800);</code> to <strong>src/scripts/main-enter.js</strong>, this is a special method that will tell Splat-ECS the size we want our game to be.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
"use strict";

module.exports = function(game) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
	game.scaleCanvasToFitRectangle(800,800);
};
</code></pre>

				<p>There is one more thing we need to do to make <code>constrain-position</code> work, that is tell it which entity to constrain, and which entity we want to keep it inside of, which in our case is the entity with the id 2 that we just created. To do this we need to revisit <strong>src/data/entities.json</strong> and add this component to the player:</p>

<pre><code class="json">
	"constrainPosition": {
		"id": 2
	}
</code></pre>

				<p>Make sure everything is saved and check the game in the browser. Now you should stop at an invisible wall when you hit the edges of the 800x800 rectangle.</p>
